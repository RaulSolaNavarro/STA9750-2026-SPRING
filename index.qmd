![Raul J Sola Navarro](assets/headshot.jpg){width=250px fig-align="left"}

I am a full-time graduate student in the **Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)** program at the Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College. Beyond my studies, I serve as a **Student Ambassador**, helping prospective students navigate their journey into data science.

My background is a blend of corporate strategy and human performance. Before joining Zicklin, I spent over a decade at **Texas Instruments** focusing on Finance & Operations. I am also a **Certified Personal Trainer** and Corrective Exercise Specialist (ISSA), driven by a passion for health and data-driven wellness.
